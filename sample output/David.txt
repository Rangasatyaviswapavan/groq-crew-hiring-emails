Hey David,

I hope you're having a great day! I'm Satya Viswa Pavan Ranga, a Masters student at Northeastern University, specializing in Statistical Modeling. Your interest in [Company]'s deployment process and bottlenecks caught my attention.

Having a Computer Science background and experience at Cognizant, I've mastered data management and statistical analysis. I've created ingestion flows for Amex and analyzed Airbnb listings with machine learning.

Given your DevOps engineer role, focusing on automation and continuous integration, I believe my Python, R, SQL, and visualization skills can significantly contribute to [Company]'s goals. I'm excited to explore potential opportunities with you!

Warm regards,
Satya Viswa Pavan Ranga
