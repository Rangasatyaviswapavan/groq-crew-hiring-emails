Hey Matthew!

I hope you're doing great! I'm Satya Viswa Pavan Ranga, a Masters student at Northeastern University, specializing in Statistical Modeling. Our conversation about new web technologies left a lasting impression on me, especially your enthusiasm!

With a background in Computer Science and Engineering and experience at Cognizant, I've developed strong skills in data management and statistical analysis. I've had the opportunity to work on exciting projects such as building data ingestion flows for Amex and analyzing Airbnb listings using machine learning.

Given your interest in frontend development, I believe my expertise in Python, R, SQL, and visualization tools could be a game-changer for optimizing the frontend performance at [Company]. I'd love to chat more about potential opportunities!

Looking forward to hearing back from you,

Satya Viswa Pavan Ranga
