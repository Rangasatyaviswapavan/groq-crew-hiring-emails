Hey Michael,

I hope you're doing great! I'm Satya Viswa Pavan Ranga, a Masters student at Northeastern University, with a focus on Statistical Modeling. We had a great conversation last time, and I was really impressed by your knowledge of new features and their impact on existing functionality.

With a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering and experience at Cognizant, I've developed strong skills in data management and statistical analysis. I've had the opportunity to work on exciting projects, such as creating ingestion flows for Amex and analyzing Airbnb listings using ML.

Given your expertise as a full-stack developer specializing in JavaScript frameworks, I believe you can make a significant contribution to our objectives, especially in areas where data-driven decision-making is critical. I'm looking forward to discussing potential opportunities further.

Best regards,
Satya Viswa Pavan Ranga
